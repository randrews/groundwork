h1. Groundwork

Creates project outlines. Often, there are a lot of boilerplate files
you need to start a project; this helps you not only create those
files, but make recipes to add new types of project.

h2. Basic use

Groundwork uses subcommands:

*@groundwork list@*

lists the known recipes, both built-in and ones you've installed

*@groundwork <recipe> <name>@*

Creates a directory called _name_ and runs the given recipe in it.

*@groundwork install <recipe_file>@*

Installs the given recipe file into ~/.groundwork

Some recipes take options, which you can see with @install <recipe> -h@

h3. Making recipes

A recipe is a script written in a Ruby DSL. It's pretty straightforward:

bc. file "file1.txt", "File 1 contents"
 
directory "dir1" do
    file "file2.txt", "File 2 contents"
end
