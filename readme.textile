h1. Groundwork

Groundwork generates project outlines. Often, there are a lot of boilerplate files you need to start a project; this helps you not only create those files, but make recipes to add new types of project.

h2. Basic use

Groundwork uses subcommands:

*@groundwork list@*

lists the known recipes, both built-in and ones you've installed

*@groundwork <recipe> <name>@*

Creates a directory called _name_ and runs the given recipe in it.

*@groundwork install <recipe_file>@*

Installs the given recipe file into ~/.groundwork

You can get help on Groundwork with *@groundwork -h@* and help for a specific command (including recipes) with *@groundwork <command> -h@*

h2. Making recipes

h3. The recipe DSL

A recipe is a script written in a Ruby DSL. It's pretty straightforward:

<pre>file "file1.txt", "File 1 contents"

directory "dir1" do
    file "file2.txt", :erb => "<%= 2 + 2 %>"
end</pre>

Most of the time you'll want to make it generate files from other files, instead of putting the contents inline. You can do so like this:

@file "filename", :from => "path/to/file"@

Or, to generate a file from an ERb template:

@file "filename", :from_erb => "path/to/file"@

h3. Compiling

If your recipe references external files, you should compile it like so:

*@groundwork compile <recipe_file>@*

This will include all the files your script reads from into the script itself, and make a self-contained file for installing.

h3. Generating

As a convenience, to easily make recipes, you can do

*@groundwork generate@*

which will make a basic recipe you can modify for the current directory.
